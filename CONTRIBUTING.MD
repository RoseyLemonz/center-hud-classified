Center HUD Classified is open to any PRs. All may not be accepted, but they will be considered. Including before/after screenshots is recommended when applicable

## Formatting / Considerations
If you do make a PR:
- For indenting, use tabs instead of spaces
- If a change involves positioning of an element, you should check the HUD on two other aspect ratios to verify that the element is still displaying correctly
- Use definitions already defined in the scheme files
- Do not modify or delete existing comments
